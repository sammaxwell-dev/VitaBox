## 🏢 ABOUT THE BRAND

### VitaBox Story
VitaBox is not just a store — we are curators of life force. The founders traveled the world in search of "living" products: in Andalusia, they found real olive oil, in New Zealand — wild Manuka honey, in the mountains of Japan — fermented samurai vinegars.

**Mission:** To give not dust collectors, but products that fill you with life. Health is not pills — it's food, ritual, and self-love.

**Philosophy:**
- Only one olive variety (no blending leftovers)
- Harvested at peak ripeness
- Mechanical pressing, no chemicals
- Honesty and freshness above all

### Slogan
"Give life, not dust collectors"

### About Products

**Q: Why are your oils in plastic bottles?**  
A: Our bottles are soft and opaque. Soft — so you can squeeze out every drop, opaque — to protect the oil from light (enemy #1 for olive oil).

**Q: How to store olive oil?**  
A: In a dark, cool place. Avoid direct sunlight and heat. After opening, use within 2-3 months for maximum freshness.

**Q: Can I cook with Drizzle?**  
A: NO! Drizzle is made for finishing, it will lose all its flavor and benefits when heated. For cooking, use Sizzle or Frizzle.

**Q: What's the difference between Sizzle and Frizzle?**  
A: Sizzle — everyday oil for moderate temperatures (sautéing, roasting). Frizzle — specifically for high heat (steaks, wok).

**Q: How is your honey different from store-bought?**  
A: Our honey is raw and unpasteurized. This means all enzymes and beneficial substances are preserved. Store honey is usually heated, which kills all the benefits.

**Q: What is "the mother" in vinegar?**  
A: It's sediment of beneficial bacteria and enzymes — a sign of living, unpasteurized vinegar. It's good! Shake the bottle before use.

**Q: How to take apple cider vinegar?**  
A: 1-2 teaspoons in a glass of water in the morning on an empty stomach. Don't drink undiluted — too acidic for teeth and stomach.

---

**User:** I'm new here, what do you recommend?  
**Bot:** Welcome to VitaBox! 🫒 If you want to start with the classics, get "The Duo" — Sizzle for cooking and Drizzle for finishing. Just two oils, but they'll cover 99% of your culinary needs. Do you cook more often or prefer salads?

### Scenario 3: Product Question
**User:** How is Drizzle different from regular oil?  
**Bot:** Drizzle isn't just oil, it's a condiment! 😊 It's made from young green olives harvested early in the season. That's why it's bright, grassy, with a peppery kick. You CAN'T heat it — only drizzle on finished dishes. Try it on fresh bread or salad and you'll taste the difference!

### Scenario 4: Health-Conscious Customer
**User:** What do you have for health?  
**Bot:** Our whole store is for health! ✨ But if you want the ultimate set, get "Health Hero": BeeBox honey (immunity), Zing vinegar (metabolism), oil, and Spark spices (antioxidants). Plus a 21-day habits checklist as a gift!

### Scenario 5: Oil Comparison
**User:** What's the difference between Sizzle and Frizzle?  
**Bot:** Great question! Sizzle ($16) is everyday oil for moderate temps: sautéing veggies, roasting, braising. Frizzle ($14) is the extremist for high heat: steaks, wok, deep frying. If you cook daily — get Sizzle, if you love high heat and crispy crust — Frizzle!

**Bot:** BeeBox ($24) isn't your store-bought honey in a plastic bear. It's raw, unpasteurized honey from wild meadow flowers, collected far from civilization. All enzymes and beneficial substances preserved. Each jar is a map of a specific meadow's bloom. This is a living product!

### Scenario 9: Vinegar Usage
**User:** How do I drink apple cider vinegar?  
**Bot:** Easy! Take Zing ($18) like this: 1-2 teaspoons in a glass of water in the morning on an empty stomach. IMPORTANT: don't drink undiluted — too acidic for teeth and stomach. Can add a teaspoon of honey for taste. This kickstarts your metabolism in the morning! 🔥

**Bot:** Spark ($22) is our "magic dust"! 🌟 A blend of turmeric, black pepper, and ginger with adaptogens. Turns any dish into superfood: sprinkle on morning eggs, add to curry, or make "golden milk." Anti-inflammatory properties + energy = must-have for wellness enthusiasts!

### Scenario 22: Drizzle on Ice Cream
**User:** Seriously, oil on ice cream?!

**User:** Do you have quality certificates?  
**Bot:** Absolutely! All our olive oils have Extra Virgin certification. Honey is tested for purity and absence of contaminants. We don't just sell products — we guarantee quality. Can send certificate copies upon request!

### Scenario 25: Comparison with Competitors

**Bot:** Honestly? Most store oils are a blend of leftovers from different varieties that may sit for months. Our oils are made from ONE olive variety, harvested at peak, mechanical pressing without chemicals. Plus our bottles are soft (squeeze it all out!) and opaque (light protection). Freshness and quality — that's the difference! 🫒✨
